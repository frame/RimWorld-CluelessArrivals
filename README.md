Adds a new industrial player faction that starts without any predefined research.

## Background and similar mods
The reason for this mod is that I wanted to play a crash landed party with an industrial culture, that still needs to work their way up. **Warning**: Special events that target the normal vanilla New Arrivals faction won't be triggered and save games will break if mod is removed.

There are two similar mods, with some key differences:

[Completely Clueless](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1710183197): This mod just patches the existing faction. By doing this, you won't miss out on any content that targets the normal vanilla factions like say for example wanderer events, which are faction-specific. This mod is probably the best choice.

[Tribals Know Nothing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=913240446): Very similar to my mod, this adds a new neolithic faction.

## Saved Games and Compatibility
Saves you started with the new faction will be **unplayable** if this mod is removed, however it would be easy for some players to fix it by replacing "CluelessColony" with "PlayerColony" at two locations in the save file.
